# Little Shop of Orders, v2

BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project


## Background and Description

"Little Shop of Orders" is a ficticious e-commerge platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Merchant users can mark items as 'fulfilled', and Admins can mark orders as 'complete'. Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

Students will be put into 3 or 4 person groups to complete the project.


## Learning Goals

- Advanced Rails routing (nested resources and namespacing)
- Advanced ActiveRecord for calculating statistics
- Average HTML/CSS layout and design for UX/UI
- Session management and use of POROs for shopping cart
- Authentication, Authorization, separation of user roles and permissions


## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.1.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- must use 'bcrypt' for authentication
- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use good GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and use of a project planning tool like waffle.io
- must include a thorough README to describe their project

## Not Permitted

- do not use JavaScript for pagination or sorting controls


## User Stories



## Rubric, Evaluations, and final Assessment

Each team will meet with an instructor at least two times before the project is due.

- At first team progress check-in, about 33% of the work is expected to be completed satisfactorally
- At second team progress check-in, about 66% of the work is expected to be completed satisfactorally
- Final submission will expect 100% completion

Each team will have a rubric uploaded to [https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions)
